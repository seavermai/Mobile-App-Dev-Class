        Click on each question to display my answer.<hr>
        <h2>Q1. What is the goal of the application?</h2>
        <div class="hidden">
            The goal of the application is to provide a quick and simple
            checklist application for tasks such as to-do lists and shopping
            lists.
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q2. Describe your target audience.</h2>
        <div class="hidden">
            My target audience is anyone who would seek to improve or maintain
            their efficiency and organization through the use of a checklist,
            right on their mobile device.
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q3. Find at least 3 apps that deal with a similar topic as yours.</h2>
        <div class="hidden">
            It shares similarities with basic apps that take notes, such as
            the default Android Memo app, the default iPhone Notes app, and the
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.checklist.android&hl=en">Checklist app</a> 
            by Checklist.com for Android.
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q4. Briefly describe what you like about them.</h2>
        <div class="hidden">
            I've made use often out of both the Notes app on my iPhone 5 and the 
            Memo app on my Samsung Galaxy S5. More recently, I had used the Memo 
            app to keep track of my weight-lifting and fitness progress overtime. 
            I have also looked at the Checklist app, though I haven't personally 
            used it yet. I enjoyed the simplicity of both Notes and Memo. 
            Checklist offers a ton more functionality, such as scheduling 
            reminders and events.
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2>Q5. Describe their weaknesses.</h2>
        <div class="hidden">
            Likewise, the Notes and Memo apps were too simplistic for other needs. 
            As a result, whenever I had a series of tasks or had to go shopping, 
            it was a little frustrating to modify each task as "completed" - I 
            would have to go into the editing feature to manually erase each 
            entry in order to denote that I was done. The Checklist app, while 
            powerful, offered too many extra features that I didn't need, thus 
            increasing the learning curve for using it.
        </div>

        <h2>Q6. Write 5 adjectives that best describe your application.</h2>
        <div class="hidden">
            - Convenient<br>
            - Simplistic<br>
            - Efficient<br>
            - Useful<br>
            - Versatile<br>
